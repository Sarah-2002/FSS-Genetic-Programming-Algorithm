# FSS-Genetic-Programming-Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of a genetic programming algorithm for optimizing Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) technology. we seek to enhance the efficiency and performance of FSS by finding the most optimal combination of layers, spacing, and material characteristics.
